    <p>So I got myself a Korg Monotron for Christmas, but after a few hours of messing around, I decided that it was super cool, but not very musical.</p>
    <p>Ideally, I wanted to be able to use this thing in the studio, but the lack of stepped pitch control (notes are played on a ribbon) and the inability to 
		sync the LFO to a bpm meant that it was tough to make anything worth listening to.</p>
    <p>And so my poor Monotron sat unused for months until I stumbled upon Marc Nostromo's Nostromotron mod 
		<a href="https://www.marc-nostromo.com/midi-control-for-the-monotron-using-a-teensy-3-0/" >here</a> and got inspired.</p>
    <br>
	<h3>Criteria</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>some way to sync the LFO to a bpm</li>
			<li>plug-and-play MIDI control</li>
			<li>preserve all original functionality</li>
		</ul>
	<br>
	<h3>The LFO</h3>
	<p>Found <a href="http://houshu.at.webry.info/">this mod</a> while digging around reddit, but it may be a little confusing if you can't read kanji.</p>
	<p>Essentially, you're using a diode to prevent voltage buildup from retriggering the LFO normally, creating an envelope.</p>
	<p><i>In the synth world, an envelope is simply an LFO that doesn't retrigger.</i></p>
	<p>You can also toggle between LFO and ENV behavior by adding a switch, preserving the original functionality but allowing some control of the rate. Neat! 
		Here's the schematic:</p>
		<center><img src="images/monotron/monotron_lfo.png" style="max-width: 66%"></center>
	<br>
	<p>Start by soldering a wire to each of the VCC and LFO pads:</p>

	<p>If you want to be able to toggle between LFO and ENV modes, include a switch between the LED and the monotron, like in the schematic. Otherwise you can 
		just solder the LFO wire to the ground leg of the LED, and then the VCC wire to the positive leg of the LED.</p>
	<p>Bam, all done.</p>
	
	<h3>MIDI control</h3>
		<p>This is the bread and butter of this build. It was definitely not easy to figure out, but thankfully you have me!</p>
		<p>After a little research, I chose the Teensy for an MCU because of it's built-in class compliant MIDI mode. This means that 
			you can plug it into any computer and it'll be recognized as a MIDI instrument with no setup required. This is great because there's no messing with MIDI-yoke
			which, in my humble opinion, is unbearably shitty.</p>
		<p>I'll add some schematics here later.</p>
		
	<h3> Materials </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>teensy 3.0 or later</li>
			<li>resistor kit</li>
			<li>two 10nF ceramic capacitors</li>
			<li>stripboard</li>
			<li>soldering kit</li>
			<li>an MCP4822</li>
			<li>an LED </li>
		</ul>
