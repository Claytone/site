    <h1 style = "text-align: center">Hi, I'm Clayton.</h1>
    <p>I'm a 21 year old programmer/musician/DJ currently working on a bachelor's in Computer Science at Texas A&M University.</p>
    <p>For DJing, I specialize in social events and parties, but I'm comfortable playing any format and any genre.</p>
    <p>You'll find examples of my art and music in the sidebar. I can do logo design, flyers, whatever.</p>
    <p>If you want to book me, contact me on social media (sidebar) or shoot me an email at clayton.wells.321@gmail.com</p>

    <p>Coming soon: Gonna put together a section for all of my random projects, may even include some tutorials.</p>
